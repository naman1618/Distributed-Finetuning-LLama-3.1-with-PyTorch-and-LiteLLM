# Troubleshooting Guide for Distributed Fine-tuning

This document covers common issues you might encounter when setting up and running the distributed fine-tuning script for the Meta Llama 3.1 70B model.

## 1. NCCL Errors

### Issue: NCCL initialization failed
```
NCCL error in: ../torch/csrc/distributed/c10d/NCCLUtils.hpp:275, unhandled system error
```

**Solution:**
- Ensure that the `NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME` is set correctly for your network interface.
- Try disabling NCCL's InfiniBand usage: `export NCCL_IB_DISABLE=1`
- Increase NCCL debug level: `export NCCL_DEBUG=INFO`

## 2. Connection Issues

### Issue: Unable to connect to master node
```
Connection to master node failed
```

**Solution:**
- Verify that the master node's IP address is correct in all scripts and config files.
- Check if the specified port is open and not blocked by firewalls.
- Ensure all nodes can ping each other.

## 3. GPU-related Issues

### Issue: CUDA out of memory
```
RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory
```

**Solution:**
- Reduce the batch size in the script.
- Ensure no other processes are using GPU memory.
- If possible, use GPUs with more memory.

## 4. API-related Issues

### Issue: API rate limit exceeded
```
Error: API rate limit exceeded
```

**Solution:**
- Implement exponential backoff in API calls.
- Reduce the frequency of API calls if possible.
- Contact the API provider to increase your rate limit.

## 5. Distributed Training Issues

### Issue: Nodes out of sync
```
Nodes appear to be out of sync. Training results may be incorrect.
```

**Solution:**
- Ensure all nodes are using the same version of the code and dependencies.
- Verify that the random seeds are set consistently across all nodes.
- Check network stability between nodes.

## 6. Data Loading Issues

### Issue: Dataset not found or corrupted
```
FileNotFoundError: Dataset file not found
```

**Solution:**
- Verify that the dataset is correctly downloaded and located in the expected directory.
- Ensure all nodes have access to the dataset.
- Check for any corruption in the dataset files.
